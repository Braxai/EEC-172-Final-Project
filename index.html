            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                Mind Invaders is a retro arcade game inspired by Space Invaders. It's name is an homage to an idea that never came to fruition. However, it developed into a complete project that demonstrates the fundamental concepts learned throughout the EEC 172 Embedded Systems course. Mind Invaders is different from it's predecessor in three primary ways. The first is the game has two input methods in an Xbox controller and the CC3200 Launchpad accelerometer. The second is a power management system where different weapons consume power and the player loses if they run out of power. The final addition is a minigame the player can enter where they control the character with the Launchpad accelerometer and have to dodge randomly generated red circles for ten seconds to receive a reward.

            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>
                The primary hardware components are the CC3200 Launchpad with it's in built accelerometer, an OLED display, Xbox controller, and a blutooth module that helps connect the Xbox controller.
